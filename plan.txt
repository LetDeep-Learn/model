Perfect — you’ve got a great dataset mix. With **900 paired** image→sketch examples and **\~15k unpaired sketches**, we can build a model that (1) learns faithful image→sketch mapping from the pairs and (2) leverages the large unpaired sketch set to push outputs onto the *real sketch manifold* (so results look natural, not random). Below I’ll give a concrete, step-by-step plan (no code yet) that balances fidelity (don’t hallucinate) and realism (look like real sketches). I’ll include architectures, losses, training schedule, hyperparams, diagnostics, and several pragmatic options depending on compute/time.

# Big-picture strategy (what I recommend)

1. **Strong supervised base** — train a supervised conditional model on the 900 pairs with *strong reconstruction/perceptual losses* so the generator learns to reproduce the input photo’s structure (no random generation).
2. **Use the 15k sketches to teach “sketch-ness”** — do this *without breaking the input→output fidelity* by adding *unconditional sketch-domain guidance*: e.g., a discriminator (or sketch autoencoder) trained on the 15k sketches that encourages generated outputs to fall into that real-sketch distribution. Crucially, keep the supervised losses strong so the generator doesn’t ignore the photo.
3. **Fine-tune adversarially** — after a supervised warm-up, fine-tune with adversarial loss(s) and feature-matching to add realistic stroke textures while preserving content.

This avoids the common pitfall of purely unpaired methods (CycleGAN style) that can produce arbitrary sketches unrelated to the input photo.

# Concrete pipeline (step-by-step)

## Phase A — Preprocessing & data

* Resize / center-crop images to a fixed size (256×256 or 512×512 depending on GPU).
* Strong data augmentation on the 900 pairs: random flips, rotations ±10°, color jitter, random crops, slight perspective jitter. This increases effective paired set.
* Normalize images to \[0,1] or \[-1,1] depending on network activations.
* For the 15k sketches, optionally augment (small rotations, contrast jitter) so discriminator/generalizer sees variety.

## Phase B — Pretrain supervised generator

* **Model**: a conditional UNet (pix2pix-style) or encoder-resnet-decoder. UNet is simple and effective for structure-preserving tasks.
* **Losses** (start with these heavy weights to force fidelity):

  * L1 pixel loss between generated and ground-truth sketch: `L_l1` (weight \~100).
  * Perceptual loss (VGG relu layers, e.g., relu3\_3 + relu4\_1): `L_perc` (weight 1–5). Perceptual helps strokes align better than raw L2.
  * (Optional) SSIM or gradient loss to emphasize edges: small weight.
* **Optimizer**: Adam, lr = 2e-4, betas = (0.5, 0.999).
* **Train**: until validation L1/perceptual plateaus — e.g., 100–200 epochs or X iterations depending on compute.
* This step yields a generator that reliably maps photo → sketch structure (minimizes hallucination).

## Phase C — Train sketch autoencoder (optional but powerful)

* Train a **sketch autoencoder** (or VAE, or discriminator-style classifier) on the 15k sketches to learn the *sketch manifold* / latent space:

  * Encoder → latent z (256–1024 dims) → decoder reconstruct sketch.
  * Loss: L1/L2 + perceptual on reconstructed sketches.
* Use this autoencoder to:

  * Compute a **latent perceptual loss**: force generator(output) to have a similar latent code to the ground-truth sketch (when paired) or at least be close to real sketch latent distribution.
  * Or use the encoder as a feature extractor for a *feature matching* loss (compare encoder features of generated vs real sketches).
* Benefit: uses lots of unpaired sketch data to learn what a sketch looks like and gives a stable target for generator.

## Phase D — Adversarial fine-tuning (leverage 15k sketches)

Combine two adversarial signals (both help while preserving fidelity):

1. **Conditional PatchGAN (paired)**

   * Discriminator `D_c` takes concatenated (photo, sketch) pairs; real pairs are the 900 ground-truth pairs; fake pairs use (photo, G(photo)).
   * This enforces *consistency* between the input image and output sketch. Because `D_c` sees the photo, it discourages random outputs that don't match the input.

2. **Unconditional/Sketch Discriminator (unpaired)**

   * Discriminator `D_u` discriminates between *real sketches* (from 15k) and *generated sketches*. This forces generated outputs to fall into the *overall sketch distribution* even when the paired ground truth is limited.
   * You can also use multiple scales (multi-scale PatchGAN) for richer textures.

3. **Feature matching + perceptual on discriminator features**

   * Use feature matching loss (L1 between intermediate D\_u features for real vs fake) to stabilize adversarial training and preserve stroke statistics rather than letting D push to extreme modes.

4. **Loss weights**

   * Keep L1/perceptual as the dominant force for content: e.g., `L = λ_l1 L_l1 + λ_perc L_perc + λ_adv (L_adv_cond + L_adv_uncond) + λ_fm L_fm`.
   * Good starting weights: `λ_l1 = 100`, `λ_perc = 1`, `λ_adv = 1`, `λ_fm = 10`. Increase/decrease adversarial terms slowly.

5. **Identity / reconstruction regularizer (stability trick)**

   * If you run G on a *real sketch* input (i.e., feed a sketch instead of photo), encourage the output to reproduce it (identity loss). This helps avoid mode collapse and keeps G invertible-ish.

## Phase E — Iterative training schedule

* **Stage 1**: Pretrain G with only L1 + perceptual on 900 pairs (fast). Save checkpoints.
* **Stage 2**: Train sketch autoencoder on 15k sketches (parallel).
* **Stage 3**: Fine-tune generator with discriminators (D\_c + D\_u), feature-matching and continued L1/perceptual. Use small adversarial weight initially (0.1→1.0 ramp-up).
* **Stage 4**: Monitor validation (paired set) for fidelity metrics (L1, LPIPS, SSIM) and visual checks. Stop when adversarial fine-tuning starts to reduce fidelity on validation.

# Architectures & hyperparameters (concrete)

## Generator

* UNet:

  * Input: 3×256×256 photo
  * Down: conv layers doubling channels 64→128→256→512 (with BatchNorm/LeakyReLU)
  * Bottleneck with few res blocks (2–4)
  * Up: ConvTranspose with skip connections
  * Output: 1×256×256 (Sketch) with `tanh` or `sigmoid`.
* Channels: base=64, max 512.
* Use InstanceNorm or BatchNorm per experiment.

## Discriminators

* Conditional PatchGAN `D_c` input channels = 3(photo) + 1(sketch) = 4; use 70×70 PatchGAN.
* Unconditional PatchGAN `D_u` input channels = 1 (sketch). Multi-scale: run at 256,128,64.

## Sketch autoencoder

* Encoder: conv layers to reduce to latent 512–1024
* Decoder: mirror upsampling
* Loss: L1 + perceptual

## Loss weights (starting)

* `λ_l1 = 100`
* `λ_perc = 1`
* `λ_adv_cond = 1` (start small)
* `λ_adv_uncond = 1`
* `λ_fm = 10` (feature matching)
* Learning rate: 2e-4 for G, 2e-4 for D, linear decay after some epochs.
* Optimizer: Adam(β1=0.5, β2=0.999)
* Batch size: 4–16 (depending on GPU). If only CPU, use small images (128px) or do inference-only.

# How this prevents “random” outputs

* The **paired L1/perceptual loss** forces the generator to reproduce the ground-truth sketch structure for each photo; that’s your main fidelity anchor.
* The **conditional discriminator** further enforces that generated sketch aligns to the input photo — it looks at the photo+sketch pair, so the sketch has to match the photo.
* The **unconditional sketch discriminator** (trained on 15k sketches) only enforces *style*, not content, so it won’t cause the generator to produce random sketches unrelated to the input — it only nudges the generator to make strokes and textures resemble real sketches.
* Keep L1/perceptual weight large relative to adversarial weight — this is the single most important rule to avoid randomization.

# Diagnostics & evaluation (what to watch)

* Quantitative:

  * L1 / L2 on validation pairs (structure fidelity).
  * LPIPS (perceptual distance) between generated and ground-truth.
  * SSIM for structural similarity.
* Qualitative:

  * Visual validation grids: (photo, ground-truth sketch, generated sketch).
  * Check failure cases (faces, textures, hair) specifically.
* Training signals to watch:

  * If discriminator loss collapses to zero and generator loss explodes -> lower adversarial weight.
  * If L1 goes up during adversarial fine-tune → adversarial term overpowering; lower its weight.
* Maintain checkpoints and early stopping on validation L1 + human inspection.

---

# Practical tips & tricks

* **Start small**: pretrain G only, make sure it reproduces paired sketches well. Save that checkpoint — you’ll never regret having a quality supervised baseline.
* **Ramp adversarial weight**: start with small adversarial weight (0.1) and grow slowly if visuals look good.
* **Use feature matching** (L1 between D\_u activations) — stabilizes training and reduces hallucination.
* **Multi-scale discriminators** for texture fidelity (stroke scale).
* **Augment paired data heavily** since 900 is modest.
* **Use mixed precision (amp)** if GPU supports it to speed training and allow larger batch sizes.
* **If you see blur**: increase perceptual weight or add adversarial signal.
* **If you see random strokes**: lower adversarial weight and increase L1/perceptual.

# Deliverables I can provide next (pick one)

* A step-by-step runnable repo skeleton implementing this pipeline (preproc, dataset, UNet G, D\_c + D\_u, sketch-autoencoder, training scripts, inference), with recommended hyperparams and default presets tuned for 256×256.
* Or, start by producing only the **training plan + config file** (YAML) and then implement incrementally: 1) supervised pretrain script; 2) sketch autoencoder script; 3) adversarial fine-tune script.
* Or, produce a minimal code demo that trains only the supervised UNet on your 900 pairs so you can validate fidelity immediately.

# Recommendation (one clear path)

1. Pretrain UNet on 900 pairs with `L1(=100) + perceptual(=1)` until it faithfully reproduces sketches.
2. Train sketch autoencoder on 15k sketches (latent features).
3. Fine-tune with `D_c` (paired conditional) + `D_u` (unconditional sketches) + feature-matching, ramping adversarial weights. Keep L1/perceptual strong.
4. Iterate, visualize, and stop adversarial fine-tune if paired fidelity degrades.

If you like this plan I’ll do one of the following next (no code until you confirm):

* produce a compact runnable repo (training + inference) that implements the recommended pipeline, or
* give the **exact code** for Stage 1 (supervised UNet training) so you can start training now and verify fidelity quickly.

Which would you prefer to start with?
